/**
    \brief ClearCore Board Non-Volatile Memory Interface

    This class manages the non-volatile memory of the Teknic ClearCore board.

    Data is stored in the USER section of memory.
    the User section is protected from Chip Erase, making it ideal for
    persistent info like MAC Address, Serial Config, etc.
    The User section is erasable by page, and writable by quad word.
    We keep a page cached so that we know what to write back once we clear the
    page.
    The writes will write the cache back to memory quad word at a time.

    \note Writing to NVM does not immediately update what will be read from
    that memory, this is why we read from cache.

    \note Access will fail if the UF2 boot loader has not been run
